# ðŸ’ª Personal Trainer App 

> Because tracking fitness progress on sticky notes is *so* 2005.

A React application for personal trainers who are tired of Excel spreadsheets and want to manage their clients and sessions without pulling their hair out.

## ðŸŒŸ Features

- **Customer Management** - Add, view, edit, and delete clients faster than they can say "one more rep"
- **Training Sessions** - Schedule workouts that clients will probably reschedule anyway
- **Calendar View** - See your entire month of torture sessions at a glance
- **Analytics** - Pretty charts to prove you're actually doing something with all that client data
- **Export to CSV** - For when your boss still insists on seeing everything in Excel

## ðŸš€ Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Node.js (v14+)
- An IDE (or Notepad if you're feeling adventurous/masochistic)
- Coffee (lots of it)

### Local Development

```bash
# Clone the repo
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/personal-trainer-app.git

# Navigate to project folder (this is the hard part)
cd personal-trainer-app

# Install dependencies (and pray npm doesn't throw 643 warnings)
npm install

# Start development server (and your journey to becoming a React ninja)
npm run dev
